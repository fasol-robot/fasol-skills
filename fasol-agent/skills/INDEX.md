# Fasol Skill — Sub-skills directory

This directory holds **focused sub-skills**, each describing one capability of
the Fasol Agent API in detail. The top-level [`SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md) is the
shared context (auth, rate limits, common pitfalls). Sub-skills are loaded on
demand — when the agent needs to do something specific, it reads the matching
file from `skills/` instead of carrying the whole monolith in context.

> **Programmatic discovery:** [`skills.json`](../skills.json) in the parent
> directory holds the same catalog as machine-readable JSON. Use it when the
> agent runtime supports search ("find a skill that does X"); use this file
> when a human is reading.

## How to use

1. Read [`../SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md) **first** — it covers auth (`fsl_live_…`),
   rate-limit tiers, wallet binding, the "API key vs. web API" distinction, and
   safety rules. Every sub-skill assumes that context.
2. Skim [`changelog.md`](changelog.md) — last 10 changes to API or skill text.
   If a sub-skill was changed in the last week, read its full file instead of
   relying on memory.
3. Pick the sub-skill matching the user's request from the catalog below.
4. Read **only** that sub-skill's file. Don't preload others "just in case" —
   that's exactly what this split is meant to avoid.

## Catalog

All sub-skills below are extracted and self-contained. The parent SKILL.md
keeps shared context (auth, tiers, wallet binding) and a brief overview;
detail lives here.

## Reading order — first-time agent

1. [`../SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md) — shared context (auth, tiers, wallet binding, safety).
2. [`changelog.md`](changelog.md) — what's recently changed.
3. [`get-scope.md`](get-scope.md) — confirm what your key can do.
4. The sub-skill matching the user's request — for example
   [`swap.md`](swap.md) for "buy this token" or
   [`tracked-wallet-trades.md`](tracked-wallet-trades.md) for "build me a
   copy-trader."
